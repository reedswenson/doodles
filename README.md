# Reed's Code Doodles

These projects are just my ramblings.  Most are either personal utilities or experiments I use to teach myself new techniques or technologies.  Feel free to use them as you wish.  I in no way guarantee that they are free of bugs, or are of any notable quality whatsoever.

## Projects

* conway - A simple-minded implementation of Conway's Game of life using JQuery & an HTML 5 Canvas.  For game rules, please check out the [Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).  Next Actions:
  * Needs to be double-buffered so that the frame speed remains constant.
  * It would be nice if patterns could be randomly generated, saved, and loaded.

# pigrrl2_keys - A python debian service that will allow scripts to be bound to retropie key bindings.  I use this service to bind mute, volume, and shutdown controls to the TFT screen keys.
